# JantungIn API Project Status

## Overview

JantungIn API is a comprehensive backend system for a cardiovascular health monitoring and diagnosis application. The API has been successfully configured to serve both API endpoints and static documentation.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. API Documentation Access

✅ **Documentation Access Configuration**

- Successfully configured Hapi.js to serve static files from `public` directory
- Added `/docs` and `/api-docs` routes for redirecting to documentation
- Created an index.html with automatic redirect to API documentation
- API Documentation is now accessible via multiple routes:
  - `http://localhost:3000/`
  - `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
  - `http://localhost:3000/docs`
  - `http://localhost:3000/api-docs.html`

### 2. Testing Infrastructure

✅ **Test Scripts Creation**

- Created basic test scripts (`test-api.js`, `test-endpoint.js`) for quick validation
- Developed comprehensive test script (`test-all-endpoints.js`) for thorough testing
- Added documentation on how to perform tests (`TESTING.md`)

### 3. Endpoint Implementation

✅ **Authentication Endpoints**

- Registration (`/auth/register`, `/api/auth/register`)
- Login (`/auth/login`, `/api/auth/login`)
- Email-based login (`/api/auth/login-email`)
- Profile management (`/auth/profile`, `/api/auth/profile`)

✅ **Diagnosis Endpoints**

- Create diagnosis (`/api/diagnosis`)
- Get diagnosis history (`/api/diagnosis/history`)
- Get diagnosis details (`/api/diagnosis/{id}`)
- Admin-only diagnosis endpoints

✅ **Administration Endpoints**

- Admin login (`/api/admin/login`)
- Patient management
- Admin user management
- Dashboard and statistics

✅ **Health and Utility Endpoints**

- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- NIK debugging endpoint (`/api/auth/debug-nik`)

## Testing Status

### Documentation Access

✅ All documentation access points are working correctly

### Health Endpoint

✅ Health endpoint is returning proper status

### Authentication Endpoints

❓ Needs thorough testing with valid credentials

### Diagnosis Endpoints

❓ Needs thorough testing with proper authentication

### Admin Endpoints

❓ Needs thorough testing with admin credentials

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Comprehensive Testing

- Run the complete test suite (`test-all-endpoints.js`)
- Verify authentication flows with valid credentials
- Test diagnosis creation and retrieval
- Test admin functionality

### 2. Security Review

- Ensure proper authentication for all protected endpoints
- Verify role-based access controls
- Check for any potential security vulnerabilities

### 3. Performance Testing

- Test API under load
- Measure response times for critical endpoints
- Optimize database queries if necessary

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Ensure API documentation is complete and accurate
- Add examples for all endpoints
- Include error handling information

### 5. Deployment Preparation

- Finalize environment configurations
- Prepare for production deployment
- Set up monitoring and logging

## Conclusion

The JantungIn API project has made excellent progress with all planned endpoints implemented and the documentation system working correctly. The focus now should be on thorough testing of all endpoints to ensure they function as expected with proper authentication and authorization.
